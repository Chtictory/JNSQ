## GPP_Rescale

GPP_Rescale is an optional mod that rescales the JNSQ solar system to 4x its normal size, or about 10x stock scale, making it a real scale solar system. Rescaling is accomplished without the use of Sigma Dimensions. JNSQ_Rescale also works with GEP and GPP (secondary mode) using the 10x rescale mods that come with GEP and GPP. The following installations are possible:

  * JNSQ + JNSQ_Rescale
  * JNSQ + GEP + GEP_Rescale
  * JNSQ + GPP + GPP_Secondary + GPP_Rescale
  * JNSQ + GPP + GPP_Secondary + GPP_Rescale + GEP + GEP_Rescale

For any other combination of planet packs, rescaling should be performed using Sigma Dimensions without JNSQ_Rescale.

To install JNSQ_Rescale:

1. Download and install the JNSQ planet pack per the installation instructions.

2. Download and install any other applicable planet packs and optional mods (see options above).

3. Drill down to [JNSQ Download]\Optional Mods\JNSQ_Rescale\ and select Rescale_10X_(realScale).

4. Copy the selected GameData folder into your KSP install.

5. Delete the Kopernicus cache, i.e. the *.bin files located within each planet pack's "Cache" folder.
