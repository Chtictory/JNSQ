## JNSQ_Rescale

JNSQ_Rescale is an optional mod that allows JNSQ to be resized from its normal 1/4th real scale to either 1/10th real scale or real scale, by applying dimensional multipliers of 0.4 and 4 respectively. These scales are referred to more commonly as 1x and 10x, indicating their size relative to stock scale. Rescaling is accomplished without the use of Sigma Dimensions (these mods should never be used in combination with Sigma Dimensions). JNSQ also works with GEP and/or GPP (secondary mode) in any of the following installation options, using the appropriate JNSQ, GEP and GPP rescale mods to provide size compatibility.

  * JNSQ                                     |
  * JNSQ + GEP                               | + applicable Rescale mods
  * JNSQ + GPP + GPP_Secondary               |   (scales should match)
  * JNSQ + GPP + GPP_Secondary + GEP         |

To install JNSQ_Rescale:

1. Download and install the JNSQ planet pack per the installation instructions.

2. Drill down to [JNSQ Download]\Optional Mods\JNSQ_Rescale\ and select either Rescale_1X or Rescale_10X.

3. Copy/merge the selected GameData folder into your KSP install.

4. If applicable, download and install GEP and/or GPP + GPP_Secondary and the appropriate rescale mods per their instructions.

5. Delete the Kopernicus cache, i.e. the *.bin files located within each planet pack's Cache folder.

6. It is recommended that the DSN modifier in game difficulty be set to 1.6 for 1x scale or 16 for 10x scale.


## PartRebalancer10x

PartRebalancer10x is an optional mod that makes wide-sweeping changes to the mass of parts and the density of propellants to give rockets more lifelike mass ratios so they can attain the higher performance necessary when playing at real scale (10x). It is provided as a simple alternative to using mods such as Realism Overhaul, ROMini, or SMURFF. While PartRebalancer10x certainly doesn't provide the same level of realism as Realism Overhaul, it does allow you to jump in and immediately start playing at 10x scale with parts properly balanced for the task. PartRebalancer10x is an ideal stepping stone for first-timers to 10x scale who want to experiment before making the jump to Realism Overhaul.

To install PartRebalancer10x:

1. Drill down to [JNSQ Download]\Optional Mods\JNSQ_Rescale\PartRebalancer10x\.

2. Copy/merge the GameData folder into your KSP install.
