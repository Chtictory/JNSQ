## JNSQ_Rescale

JNSQ_Rescale is an optional mod that allows either JNSQ to be resized, or other planet packs resized to fit JNSQ.  There are two distinct options that are listed and described separately below.

--------------------------------------------------

## JNSQ Resized to 1/10th Real Scale or Real Scale

JNSQ can be resized from its normal 1/4th real scale to either 1/10th real scale or real scale, by applying dimension multipliers of 0.4 and 4 respectively. These scales are referred to more commonly as 1x and 10x, indicating their size relative to stock scale. Rescaling is accomplished without the use of Sigma Dimensions (these mods should never be used in combination with Sigma Dimensions). JNSQ also works with GEP and/or GPP (secondary mode) in any of the following installation options, using the appropriate JNSQ, GEP and GPP rescale mods to provide size compatibility.

  * JNSQ                                     |
  * JNSQ + GEP                               | + applicable Rescale mods
  * JNSQ + GPP + GPP_Secondary               |   (scales should match)
  * JNSQ + GPP + GPP_Secondary + GEP         |

To install JNSQ_Rescale:

1. Download and install the JNSQ planet pack per the installation instructions.

2. Drill down to [JNSQ Download]\Optional Mods\JNSQ_Rescale\ and select either Rescale_1X or Rescale_10X.

3. Copy/merge the selected GameData folder into your KSP install.

4. If applicable, download and install GEP and/or GPP + GPP_Secondary and the appropriate rescale mods per their instructions.

5. Delete the Kopernicus cache, i.e. the *.bin files located within each planet pack's Cache folder.

6. It is recommended that the DSN modifier in game difficulty be set to 1.6 for 1x scale or 16 for 10x scale.

## Stock Sized Planet Packs Resized to JNSQ Scale

Any stock sized planet pack can be resized to be size-compatible with JNSQ using Sigma Dimensions and the provided config. The config rescales any installed planet pack by 2.56x while leaving JNSQ at its native size. If installing GEP and/or GPP, the custom rescale mods described above are recommended, as these provide greater customization than is possible using Sigma Dimensions.

To install JNSQ_Rescale:

1. Download and install the JNSQ planet pack per the installation instructions.

3. Copy/merge the selected GameData folder into your KSP install.
